Pattern Lab Fluid Engine
========================

Provides integration between the [TYPO3 Fluid template engine](https://github.com/TYPO3/Fluid) and the design tool
[Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io). The package consists of template file resolvers, template renderers and emulation
tools to write Fluid templates as a living style guide.

**Do not install this package manually - it should always be installed via the [Pattern Lab Fluid Edition](https://github.com/NamelessCoder/patternlab-fluid-edition)**

This work was kindly sponsored by [Busy Noggin](http://busynoggin.com/).
